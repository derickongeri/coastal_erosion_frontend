  aboutText:
    "The Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) & Africa Programme is a joint initiative co-financed by the European Commission and the African Union Commission. The objective of the GMES & Africa Programme is to address the growing needs of African countries to access and use Earth Observation (EO) data for the implementation of sustainable development policies across the continent.",
  moreAboutText:
    "As part of the objectives of the GMES & Africa project, the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resource and Development (RCMRD), has developed environmental monitoring tools for Coastal Erosion mapping in Comoros, Mauritius, Madagascar, and Seychelles using EO data, innovative techniques, and end-user knowledge. This involved the development of an interactive dashboard that allows the user to interactively explore areas susceptible to coastal change, a QGIS plugin to model shoreline changes, and Mapographics to provide insights and inform policies.",
